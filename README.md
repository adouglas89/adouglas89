I am a mechanical engineer, I am starting this github account to publish the "source code" of my OpenERV.org project, to make an open source energy recovery ventilator.
The source code includes CAD files, usually in Fusion 360 format, Sketchup and hopefully in the future FreeCAD, as well as documentation on the printing and assembly process,
and also the firmware for the microcontroller, of course.  Currently I work in Micropython using a Raspberry Pi Pico.
